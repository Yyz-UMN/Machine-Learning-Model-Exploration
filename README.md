# Machine-Learning-Model-Exploration

This repository is dedicated to building classic machine learning models from scratch so as to gain a better understanding about the mechanisms of each model.

**Data**

All models will be using the **Titanic passengers** dataset found on Kaggle.com

__1st: Logistic Regression (no regularization)__

 I first tried building a logistic regression model with no regularization and used batch gradient descent to estimates coefficients. Please check the Jupyter Notebook for more details (including a simple comparison to sklearn.LogisticRegression).

I would try exploring adding the regularization term and also other solvers in the future.
